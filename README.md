## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm TjaÅ¡a!
I am a first-year computer science student from Slovenia, currently exploring the world of web development and building a strong foundation in software engineering.
Although I had no prior coding experience when I began university, the challenge quickly turned into an exciting opportunity to learn. Along the way, I discovered my interest for web development, which I am now learning on my own, combining my technical skills and creativity.
